Installed prettier and eslint to imporve my code quality.
Got My componenets in including a data file with some radnom data about peoples birthdays.
Had some issues with eslint need to understand that better.
Need to add in my own CSS styling for now i will use the one i found online.
Began functionallity by making a usestate which takes in data as an inital state
On the List component i ran map over the data array and then oragnised it in the way i wanted it to show on screen.
Then used the setPeople to reset everything once the clear tasks button is clicked.
